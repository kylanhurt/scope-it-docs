# ScopeIt Call for Professionals

Our team (tentatively named “ScopeIt”) is looking to build a video streaming platform using GoodBlock’s upcoming dStor technology to host and serve video content. The objective is to offer a competitive video publication service by taking a content creator-first stance by offering favorable compensation for value created through video content, real-time micropayments via the Telos blockchain for consumption of content by premium membership viewers, and an anti-censorship stance toward user-submitted content. (White paper pending)
